# UNDYNE
UrbaN DYNamic Exposure model

The UNDYNE model is based on a time-microenvironment-activity modeling approach to dynamically distribute citizen spatiotemporally in (any) European urban area for pollutant exposure calculations.

An early version of this model was introduced and used by Ramacher et al. (2019, https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/19/9153/2019/) to  estimate the urban population exposure to NOx emissions from local shipping in three Baltic Sea harbour cities.
